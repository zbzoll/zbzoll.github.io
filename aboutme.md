My name is Zachary Zoll and I'm a first year student at Allegheny College. I grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin even though I was born in Temple, Texas. I only lived in Texas for a few weeks, then my family moved to Valparaiso, Indiana. We only lived in Indiana for three years, then my family moved to Green Bay, which is where my family lives now.

When I lived in Green Bay, I went to Southwest High School. At Southwest I was on the varsity football and basketball team my junior and senior years. Even though my senior year for football I wasn't actually a player but a student assistant for the team. I decided to put myself in this role because I wanted to focus on  basketball so I could play college ball. My senior year for basketball wasn't as successful as I wanted to be even though I got into Allegheny to and play college hoops. My senior year  was cut short because of a freak illness that happen in my left wrist which caused me to go into surgery to fix it. I had a bone infection in my wrist which ended my senior year for hoops. This made me realize you need to work hard at all aspects of life because anything can happen that will change your life.    

At Allegheny, I plan on becoming a Physics major, History minor and play basketball. With my Physics major I want to become an Aerospace Engineer. So far at Allegheny I started to make some great friends and memories. So far, college has been the best time of my life.    

The theme of this course, "Software Everywhere" relates to my life because I use software with engineering and with computer coding I do with my cousin back at home. Even though Computer Science might not be a huge impact in my future life it would be nice to understand what the IT customers are doing in the engineering field.
