Basketball was invented in Springfield, Massachusetts by the Great James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football. The first ever basketball game was played on December 21, 1891 which was game that was played 9 versus 9 game played with two peach baskets and a soccer ball. The final score of that game was 1-0. From that point on, the game of basketball has spread to become one of the powerhouse national and international sport of the world.

In today's game of basketball, basketball is not only about the physical talent but has become more of a mental game. This is where the idea of film study came into the sport. When film clips first came into the game coaches had to actually cut up film clips from film reels and put it together so their players could see the specific clips. This took hours on hours a day just watching a few clips and reputing them together. With the development of technology, film study has became way easier with the use of the web. There are many different film study products including: YouTube, Synergy and Hudl. The use of Hudl and YouTube based are used for highlight films so college coaches can watch game film of their athletes they are recruiting. While Synergy is used more for watching specific game film so coaches can see what other teams they face consistently do and how to beat them.

Synergy Sports Technology is designed by college and NBA coaches for college and NBA coaches. Synergy allows to scout any team, any player and any play with just three clicks of mouse. Synergy allows you to edit film within 12 hours of a final buzzer of a college game which allows you to be prepare for your next more quickly than waiting for other teams to share film with you. The original way to share film was by sending film to your opponent and they send it back which could take multiple days to complete the process. Without Synergy the game of basketball would not be as advanced as it is now where every single play is analyzed for the uses of coaches to teach their players.

The power of the web has also developed the professional basketball game to where it is now. For example, fan's can order an account on NBA League Pass so you can stream every single game over the web and not have to only watch the games that your TV provides. Without the power of Web the game of basketball popularity would of never became the second most viewed sport just behind the NFL. International the game of basketball has developed just as much with the use of the web. FIBA which stands for International Basketball Federation,(Fédération Internationale de Basketball) has made the professional sport of basketball into a powerhouse with both men and women basketball. Without the usage of the web the coaches of these international teams would not be able to recruit there players they need to become international powerhouses.

So without the Web the game of basketball would not be the same as we know it. As a college basketball player I witness firsthand accounts the power the web has on the very sport we all know and love.
