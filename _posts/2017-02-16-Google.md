Since 2005, YouTube has provided a forum for people to connect,inform and inspire others across the globe and acts as a distribution platform for original content creators and advertisers large and small. As a product Google, Google has made this free video service into a powerhouse that runs online video networking services. With the development of YouTube Red, which is a paid version of YouTube that gives you the ability to see viral hits, music videos and shows that you cannot find anywhere else even on YouTube's free version network.

This paid monthly subscription services takes advantage of YouTube's unstoppable success and turn user created videos into to ways to make revenue for Google. Youtube Red's number one service is it allows the removing advertisements from all videos, everywhere you watch. This is an advantage for all the viewers that want to skip all the ads, but hurts all the creators by losing revenue sources. The only way for the creators to make money is that when there is an ad on your video to click on that ad or watch the whole ad for 30 seconds. This is not a problem for the big YouTubers like; KSI, VanossGaming, Yuya, Smosh and PewDiePie, who's success came before the creation of Youtube Red, most of them even have deals with Google so they get revenue from their services on Youtube.
