### TL;DR Evaluating the use of Github and Markdown to bublish articles

During this year Fs 102 course I learned a new way to write your  papers and this way was posting them online. We posted them online by using Github and Markdown which at first was very difficult but as the year went along it became easier to use. Some of the positive of using Github is how easy it is to see your work and others to view your work. It also allows the editing process between articles very easy between students. Once you understand the process of uploading the files online to your website, which took me a month to understand, made the use of Github very easy to use.




Although Github allows your articles to be mobile-ready it had many drawbacks as well. One of these drawbacks is that anyone can see your writing if they find your link to your website. Also another drawback is your work has to be mistake free to be posted online. Github also makes it kinda tricky with the uploading of pictures for your article because they have to be creative common pictures. Although writing online this year in our FS class was fun in all I would have preferred using normal word processors like Google docs or Microsoft word.
