### TL;DR Why high school students use plagiarism so they get accepted into college. 

In today's society, getting excepted to either a college or a university is the goal for most high school students. To get into these schools you need to have a good GPA, do well on your standardized test, which include the ACT, and the SAT test, and writing your intro essays to get into school.
